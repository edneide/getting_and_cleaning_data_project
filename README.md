# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

In this project the objective was to prepare a tidy data set from Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set. The data can be downloaded from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip.

You'll find three files in this repository:

1. `CodeBook.md` describing the variables, the data, and any transformations performed.

2. `run_analysis.R` it is the code containing all the steps need to generate the final tidy data set.

3. `df_final.txt` the final tidy data set containing the mean of all variables for each subject and each activity.
